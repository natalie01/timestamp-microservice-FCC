User Stories

1- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
2- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
3 - If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
